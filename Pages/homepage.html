        <p>Arav was just 29 when he realized the power of giving. Growing up in a small village, he had seen children drop out of school simply because they couldn't afford books or uniforms. With his first scholarship money, instead of spending it on himself, Arav bought supplies for three younger kids in his neighborhood.

          Word spread quickly, and soon others in his college were inspired to do the same. What started as one small act turned into a movement — students, teachers, and even local shopkeepers began contributing. Arav didn’t just donate — he sparked a chain of kindness that transformed many lives.
          
          Today, his story reminds us that we don’t have to be rich to help. We just need to care.
